[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/eugeneware/suggestion.png)](http://travis-ci.org/eugeneware/suggestion)

## Installation

This module is installed via npm:

``` bash
$ npm install suggestion
```

## Example Usage

### Hit up google suggest with a single query

``` js
var suggest = require('suggestion');
suggest('dog training', function (err, suggestions) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(suggestions);
  /*
  [ 'dog training',
    'dog training tips',
    'dog training collars',
    'dog training classes',
    'dog training videos',
    'dog training houston',
    'dog training certification',
    'dog training books',
    'dog training chicago',
    'dog training clicker' ]
  */
})
```

### Iterate through another level of google suggest

You can get even more suggestions by appending ' a', ' b', ' c' to your
google suggest query. This does it down to one level from `a` to `z`.

*NB: currently only one level of traversal is supported. Pull requests welcome.*

``` js
var suggest = require('suggestion');
  suggest('dog training', { levels: 1 }, function (err, suggestions) {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(suggestions);
    /*
    [ 'dog training atlanta',
      'dog training austin',
      'dog training app',
